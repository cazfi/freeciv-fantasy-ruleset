          fantasy ruleset
=============================================================
fantasy is a in development ruleset which aims to be fun and strategic by using most of the features of freeciv

=============================================================
          design goals
=============================================================
the fantasy ruleset was created with some goals in mind, it should
1. be asymmetric, playing with each nation should be a very different experience
2. use most features of freeciv, there are many things added which aren't used by the classic and civ2civ3 ruleset
3. be strategic, optimal play should differ in result compared to suboptimal play
4. be balanced, there should be multiple viable strategies

=============================================================
          ideas
=============================================================
strategic resources: increase total value of output of a city per worked one
strategic resources 2: allow construction of special units
strategic resources 3: techs that need a resource, almost certain this is impossible for now
buildings that increase the output of specialists
massive populations amounts => lots of specialists
specialist tiers, technology making new ones available 
government types tiers. with the first and second giving massive penalties
city statuses, choice between log and short term, this could be a policy
choice between production and growth

=============================================================
          roadmap
=============================================================
1 mvp first stage 
  1. 8 nations 
  2. 5 techs for each tree
  3. 60 total between wonders, buildings, units
  4. implement strategic resources
  5. rebalance terrain to 1
