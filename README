          fantasy ruleset
=============================================================
fantasy is a in development ruleset which aims to be fun and strategic by using most of the features of freeciv

=============================================================
          design goals
=============================================================
the fantasy ruleset was created with some goals in mind, it should
1. be asymmetric, playing with each nation should be a very different experience
2. use most features of freeciv, there are many things added which aren't used by the classic and civ2civ3 ruleset
3. be strategic, optimal play should differ in result compared to suboptimal play
4. be balanced, there should be multiple viable strategies

=============================================================
          ideas
=============================================================
specialists give trade, science and gold, tiles give production and food
terrain specific infraestructure? only advanced basic independs of terrain
first choose between workshop and farm then depending on tech tree and terrain
different infraestructure can be created

=============================================================
          roadmap
=============================================================
1 mvp first stage 
  1. infraestructure
  2. 5 techs for each tree [ ] 
  3. 60 total between wonders, buildings, units [ ]
